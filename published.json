His highly autobiographical first novel, <em>Mud on the Stars</em>, depicts those years.

His practice of \u201ccheckbook journalism\u201d earned him scorn from his professional colleagues. His coverage of the civil rights movement had people burning crosses in his yard. Huie\u2019s books sold more than 30 million copies, and yet at the time of his death, none of them were still in print. The public library in Hartselle\u2019s historic downtown area, which was renamed in Huie\u2019s honor, has an exhibit on the writer\u2019s life and works.</span></p>"
